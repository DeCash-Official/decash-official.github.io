# Delegated Wallets

Delegated Wallets are primary wallets used across DeCash ecosystem, which can be controlled by traditional Algorand wallets.
Technically, the delegated wallet is owned by a single owner wallet, which is a traditional Algorand wallet.

[DeCash API](/docs/api/overview) provides endpoints to create and manipulate Delegated Wallets -
virtual multi-purpose wallets controlled by either end users or automated systems. Delegated Wallets abstract the Algorand
blockchain from the user completely, providing the following:

+ Same security and control level as native blockchain token with simplified access.
+ DeCash API accepts transactions from and to Delegated Wallets and pays fees in [Algo](https://algorand.foundation/governance/algo-basics) on behalf of users.
+ DeCash API abstracts the [DeCash token opt-in](/docs/concepts/tokens#token-opt-in) procedure and will automatically opt Delegated Wallets in under the hood.

You can find out all methods that allow you to work with Delegated Wallets in the [DeCash API docs](/docs/api/overview).
A clear distinction should be made between Delegated Wallets and regular Algorand wallets:

## Verifier

To check if transactions groups are of the correct form, calls to the `verifier` smart contract are included in all transactions that involve delegated wallets.

+ [app ID `661955541`](https://algoexplorer.io/application/661955541)

TestNet:
+ [app ID `71013728`](https://testnet.algoexplorer.io/application/71013728)


## Use cases

Delegated Wallets should be used for all possible use cases.

+ Making transactions between users.
+ Creating temporary (hot) wallets for accepting purchases in [DeCash Tokens](/docs/concepts/tokens) (see the [guide](/docs/guides/merchant));
+ Paying to clients (if you are an exchange), which allows to opt-in their wallets automatically;
+ Batching transactions using [one-to-many transfers](/docs/api/algorand/one-to-many-transfer), for instance, to distribute tokens in one batch;
+ Using [many-to-one transfers](/docs/api/algorand/many-to-one-transfer), for instance, to collect tokens from many Delegated Wallets in one batch.

Transferring tokens to a regular Algorand wallet instead of a delegated wallet should be considered as ramping off from DeCash ecosystem,
which should not be a usual case. However, when needed, DeCash API still allows to perform such transfers.


## Implementation details

On [Algorand](/docs/concepts/algorand/), Delegated Wallets are implemented as [Smart Signatures](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/dapps/smart-contracts/#smart-signatures).
It means that there is no smart contract deployed for each new Delegated Wallet, but rather the
Delegated Wallet itself is a unique signature having its unique Algorand account address, which
defines who and how can control DeCash tokens held at this specific Algorand address.

Simplifying the Algorand-specific concepts, Delegated Wallets can be described by the following scheme:

<CenteredImage alt="Delegated wallets" src="/img/delegated-wallets.png"/>

For instance, to transact in DeCash tokens:

1. The owner of the Delegated Wallet (the "owner") requests a delegated transaction from DeCash API, effectively
   asking it to pay the Algo fee for this transaction. For instance, this transaction can be a token transfer
	 from their Delegated Wallet to another wallet.
2. DeCash API sends the Algorand transaction to the owner to sign it.
3. The owner signs the transaction and then it is send back to DeCash API. The Smart Signature logic will
   additionally verify the owner and spending conditions.
4. DeCash API executes the signed transaction (group) in the Algorand network, paying fees in Algo and taking the
   fee for this transaction in DeCash tokens.
5. Alternatively, if the user wishes to pay fees in Algo, they can interact with the Delegated Wallet themselves
   by submitting their transactions directly to the Algorand network. Thus, they don't depend on the DeCash API.

The [Smart Signature](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/dapps/smart-contracts/#smart-signatures),
defined by a smart contract program, also defines:

+ The Algorand owner account of the Delegated Wallet this signature represents.
+ The logic of the program, allowing only the owner of this Delegated Wallet to manage its assets.
+ The provider's account used to [opt in](/docs/concepts/tokens#token-opt-in) and opt out this Delegated Wallet,
	specifically to move Algos in and out of this wallet, which is required by Algorand to have it operational.
