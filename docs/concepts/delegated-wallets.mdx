# Delegated Wallets

[DeCash API](/docs/api/overview) provides endpoints to create and manipulate Delegated Wallets -
virtual multi-purpose wallets controlled by users. Delegated Wallets provide the following key
properties to the users of DeCash tokens:

+ DeCash API accepts transactions to Delegated Wallets and pay fees in [Algo](#TODO) on behalf of users.
+ DeCash API abstracts the [DeCash token opt-in](/docs/concepts/tokens#token-opt-in) procedure and will automatically opt Delegated Wallets in.

You can find out all methods that allow you to work with Delegated Wallets in the [DeCash API docs](/docs/api/overview).


## Use cases

Delegated Wallets can be used for a variety of use cases:

+ Abstracting the Algo fee away from users (Delegated Wallet owners), allowing to pay for transactions in DeCash tokens instead of [Algos](#TODO).
+ Creating temporary (hot) wallets for accepting purchases in [DeCash Tokens](/docs/concepts/tokens) (see the [guide](#TODO));
+ Paying to clients (if you are an exchange), which allows to opt-in their wallets automatically;
+ Batching transactions using [one-to-many transfers](/docs/api/algorand/one-to-many-transfer), for instance, to distribute tokens in one batch;
+ Using [many-to-one transfers](/docs/api/algorand/many-to-one-transfer), for instance, to collect tokens from many Delegated Wallets in one batch.


## Implementation details

On [Algorand](/docs/concepts/algorand/), Delegated Wallets are implemented as [Smart Signatures](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/dapps/smart-contracts/#smart-signatures).
It means that there is no smart contract deployed for each new Delegated Wallet, but rather the
Delegated Wallet itself is a unique signature having its unique Algorand account address, which
defines who and how can control DeCash tokens held at this specific Algorand address.

Simplifying the Algorand-specific concepts, Delegated Wallets can be described by the following scheme:

For instance, to transact in DeCash tokens:

1. The owner of the Delegated Wallet (the "owner") requests a delegated transaction from DeCash API, effectively
   asking it to pay the Algo fee for this transaction. For instance, this transaction can be a token transfer
	 from their Delegated Wallet to another wallet.
2. DeCash API sends the Algorand transaction to the owner to sign it.
3. The owner signs the transaction and then it is send back to DeCash API. The Smart Signature logic will
   additionally verify the owner and spending conditions.
4. DeCash API executes the signed transaction (group) in the Algorand network, paying fees in Algo and taking the
   fee for this transaction in DeCash tokens.
5. Alternatively, if the user wishes to pay fees in Algo, they can interact with the Delegated Wallet themselves
   by submitting their transactions directly to the Algorand network. Thus, they don't depend on the DeCash API.

The [Smart Signature](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/dapps/smart-contracts/#smart-signatures),
defined by a smart contract program, also defines:

+ The Algorand owner account of the Delegated Wallet this signature represents.
+ The logic of the program, allowing only the owner of this Delegated Wallet to manage its assets.
+ The provider's account used to [opt in](/docs/concepts/tokens#token-opt-in) and opt out this Delegated Wallet,
	specifically to move Algos in and out of this wallet, which is required by Algorand to have it operational.
