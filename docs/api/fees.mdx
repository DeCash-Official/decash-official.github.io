# Fees

DeCash API takes a small fee for making transactions. This fee is withhold in the transaction amount currency: for instance,
if you're transferring 10 EURD tokens from one account to another using the [TransferTokens](/docs/api/algorand/transfer-tokens)
API endpoint, the sending account will be additionally charged 0.01 EURD.

The fee is calculated by the DeCash API, so you don't need to worry about it. This fees are provided for reference only, if
you want to calculate the fees for a high volume of transactions by yourself, when using many-to-one or one-to-many transfers.

At the moment, DeCash API takes the same fee for all currencies. DeCash may update this fee from time to time.
