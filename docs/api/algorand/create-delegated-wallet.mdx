# CreateDelegatedWallet

Create a [Delegated Wallet](/docs/concepts/delegated-wallets), given an owner wallet that controls it.

:::note
When building systems using [Delegated Wallets](/docs/concepts/delegated-wallets), you should always assume that it's possible to
get all Delegated Wallets by having the owner wallet address and vice versa. If you need to preserve higher privacy in your systems,
prefer generating a unique owner address per each delegated wallet.
