# Getting Algo

For development purposes, you will need to obtain some Algo - the Algorand blockchain currency,
which is used to perform transactions in Algorand network.

This page will guide you through the process of obtaining Algo either in the test or main [Algorand network](/docs/concepts/algorand#networks).


## Get test Algo

To get some test Algo in the [Algorand test network](/docs/concepts/algorand#networks), use the [Algorand dispenser web service](https://bank.testnet.algorand.network/).
After entering your wallet address there and solving the captcha challenge, your wallet will receive 10 Algo
in the test network shortly:

Even 10 Algos will be enough to cover hundreds of transactions in the test Algorand network, so you
don't need to ask for more.


## Get real Algo

Algo in the main [Algorand network](/docs/concepts/algorand#networks) has to be purchased on one of
the exchanges Algo token is traded on. You can find the list of the exchanges it is available at on
the [official Algorand Ecosystem page](https://algorand.foundation/governance/the-algo-ecosystem).

After purchasing Algo on the exchange, follow the exchange's instructions to withdraw it to your own
Algorand wallet. Usually, you would just need to specify your wallet's address.
