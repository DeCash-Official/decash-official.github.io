# Prepare your wallet

For the development and testing purposes, you will need the Algorand wallet. See the list
of available Algorand wallets [here](/docs/concepts/algorand#wallets); you can choose from
the mobile, browser-based or browser extension wallets.


## Opt in to DeCash tokens

:::tip
This guide is only applicable to regular Algorand wallets. When using [DeCash API](/docs/api/overview)
and [delegated wallets](/docs/concepts/delegated-wallets), the opt-in procedure is handled for you by
DeCash API. Read more in the [API](/docs/api/overview) section.
:::

In order to receive [DeCash tokens](/docs/concepts/tokens) to your newly created wallet, you need
to [opt them in](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/asa/#receiving-an-asset).

The following guide will guide you through the [Algorand Wallet](https://algorandwallet.com/).
The procedure in other wallets should be very similar.

### 1. Get some Algo

See the [Getting Algo](/docs/getting-started/getting-algo) section to get some Algo. You need to have
some Algo on your wallet to perform the opt-in transaction in Algorand.

### 2. Start adding a new asset

Make sure you have your wallet set to use the correct [network](/docs/concepts/algorand#networks). On
the screenshots below, the **test Algorand network** is used. See how to connect Algorand Wallet to the
test network [here](https://algorandwallet.com/support/develop-help-articles/connecting-to-testnet/).

### 3. Find DeCash token you need

Using [this list](/docs/concepts/tokens#token-addresses) of DeCash tokens, pick the **asset ID** of the
token you need. In the example below, we add **DeCash EURD** token, which has asset ID `51987793`.

### 4. Approve the opt-in transaction

Now click on the asset you're trying to opt in to in your Algorand Wallet and approve the transaction.

Shortly, you will have DeCash token listed in the list of tokens you own.

From now on, you can start transacting in DeCash EURD token.
