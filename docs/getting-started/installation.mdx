# Installation

When working with [DeCash API](/docs/api/overview), you will need a library to talk to it, as well
as the [SDK](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/sdks/javascript/) to manage Algorand wallets and
sign transactions, as [DeCash tokens](/docs/concepts/tokens) are Algorand assets.

We will use JavaScript and NodeJS in the examples below, but effectively you can utilize any language
Algorand provides their [SDK](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/) for.


## Algosdk

Algosdk is used to handle Algorand wallets and sign transactions provided by DeCash API.

You can add [algosdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/algosdk) to your JavaScript project by running the
following command:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install algosdk
```

Read more about how to sign transaction using algosdk and wallets in [signing transactions](/docs/guides/signing-transactions).


## Talking to DeCash API

For simplicity, we will demonstrate some examples of talking to DeCash API using [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
(or [node-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch) for NodeJS).

When talking to DeCash API from the browser, you can use `fetch()` without installing any
dependencies, while in NodeJS environment you would need to first install `node-fetch` and
then import it:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install node-fetch
```

```js
import fetch from 'node-fetch';
```

An example API invocation would be:

```js
const response = await fetch('https://api.decash.com/CreateDelegatedWallet', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    "owner": "6E63EKJYUPLL4SKM5FNX3PD7HSWZ26XPS7BXYLVWJAPDEK3VA7DERTFV4E"
  })
});
const data = await response.json();
```

Where `data` is now the following JSON object, having a generated delegated wallet you
can use further in other API calls:

```json
{
  "wallet": "DUIUUAOHRAUHVE5GXDE6OURUFWVXXFNSCOK3IMGWCZWSAASSM342O4YMAY",
}
```
